# PRODIGY_CS_05

The Network Packet Analyzer project is a powerful and versatile tool designed to capture, analyze, and interpret network traffic in real-time. This project aims to enhance network security and performance by providing detailed insights into the data packets traversing a network. It is intended for use by network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and anyone interested in understanding and optimizing network communication.

# Features
Packet Capture: Intercepts and captures network packets across various protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.). <br />
Real-Time Analysis: Provides live monitoring and analysis of network traffic, displaying packet details as they are captured. <br />
Protocol Decoding: Interprets and decodes packets according to standard protocols, showing headers, payloads, and metadata. <br />
Filtering and Search: Allows users to apply filters and search criteria to focus on specific types of traffic or data patterns. <br />
Traffic Visualization: Generates visual representations of network traffic, such as graphs and charts, to highlight trends and anomalies. <br />
Customizable Alerts: Configures alerts for specific network events or anomalies, such as unusual traffic spikes or potential security threats. <br />
Data Export: Supports exporting captured data to various formats (PCAP, CSV, JSON) for further analysis or reporting. <br />
User-Friendly Interface: Features an intuitive interface with dashboards, tables, and visualization tools for easy navigation and analysis. <br />
# Implementation
Programming Language: Primarily developed using Python due to its extensive libraries and ease of integration. <br />
Libraries Used: <br />
scapy for packet capturing and manipulation. <br />
PyQt for developing the graphical user interface. <br />
matplotlib and seaborn for traffic visualization. <br />
Database: Uses SQLite for storing captured packet data and historical analysis. <br />
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. <br />
# Security Considerations
Secure Access: Ensures that only authorized users can access and control the packet analyzer. <br />
Data Integrity: Implements measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of captured data. <br />
Ethical Usage: Emphasizes lawful and ethical use, advising users to only analyze networks they own or have explicit permission to monitor. <br />
